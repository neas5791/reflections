How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that have a logical connection to the commit.
The working directory can contain all the files related to the project.
the working directory houses all of the files not just those logically related to the
commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
you can add one file to the staging area by using the git add <file> command, then compare
the staging area to the last commit by executing the git diff --staging

 refactored this is where the programmer has to use his/her noggin to figure things out
 manually.
